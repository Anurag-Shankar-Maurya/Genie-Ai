Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
- npm or yarn
- A Google Gemini API Key. You can obtain one from Google AI Studio.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anurag-Shankar-Maurya/Genie-Ai.git
   cd Genie-Ai
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project directory. You can do this by copying the example file if one exists, or creating it from scratch:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local  # If .env.example exists
   # OR create .env.local manually
   ```

   Add your Google Gemini API key to the `.env.local` file:

   ```env
   GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
   ```

   Replace `YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE` with your actual API key.

### Running the Application

1. **Start the development server:**
   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Or using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified in your Vite config/console output).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

- **Models:** The available AI models are configured in `src/constants.ts`. You can update this list if new models become available or if you want to change the default model.
